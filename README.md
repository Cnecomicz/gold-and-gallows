# Gold & Gallows

## Welcome

Hello! This README file is currently a very early work in progress, but 
in its current form it intends to point you to several key things about 
this project.

Gold & Gallows is a **tabletop roleplaying game**. You play with pen 
and paper, dice, and (if you so choose) miniatures. It is a rules-light 
early-D&D demake (around the era of OD&D, BECMI, and AD&D 1e and 2e), 
but it has some design decisions which differ from D&D in interesting 
ways. At its core, Gold & Gallows attempts to be streamlined, player-
focused, and mechanically lethal (at least, if played... uncreatively). 
Please see the [Gold & Gallows: The TTRPG](#gold-&-gallows-the-ttrpg) 
section for more information and the opportunity to try the game 
yourself!

Gold & Gallows is also a **computer roleplaying game** I am in the 
early stages of developing. It is written in Python and while 
artistically it intends to be a compelling implementation of a setting 
using the Gold & Gallows tabletop rules, it is also an opportunity for 
me to practice using Python and in particular adopt good programming 
habits. Check out [Gold & Gallows: The CRPG](#gold-&-gallows-the-crpg) 
for more.

Gold & Gallows rules, they can be found in this very repository:

If you play the game, please let me know what you think! You can

Here are some more thoughts on the design ethos of the tabletop game.

### The design of G&G

The name Gold & Gallows is inspired by the *X*- & *X*- format common to 
the genre: Dungeons & Dragons, Tunnels & Trolls, Castles & Crusades, 
etc. I chose Gold & Gallows to emphasize two core aspects: the system 
incentivizes characters to focus on acquiring gold, and the mechanics 
are often unforgivingly lethal.

My main design goal in creating the system is to streamline and 
minimize complexity. I first cut my teeth on Pathfinder, which is a 
very rules-heavy system with a lot of things to keep in mind at the 
table, and I felt like too much of my time was spent referring back to 
those things and not playing the game. My system is designed to be very 
simple, to the point that it doesn't even require any math to play, and 
the intention is that the rules get out of the way of just having a 
good time. I think I've done well overall in this regard, since the 
[Rules Booklet](TTRPG/GnG_Rules_Booklet_6_Jan_2024.pdf) is quite short 
and there's basically only one gameplay mechanic: "Threading the 
Needle" by rolling a twenty-sided die above an enemy's stat and below 
one of your stats.

The [Rules Booklet](TTRPG/GnG_Rules_Booklet_6_Jan_2024.pdf) is the only 
thing you need to start playing. It's about 20 pages. You might scoff 
at my claim that that's short, but in comparison to almost every other 
system you'll encounter it's tiny (with the exception of extremes like 
one-page rpgs). A third of it is the mechanics for each class, of which 
any player would only need to know one out of the ten total. A full 
half of it is spells, which not every class uses and the ones that do 
will start with hardly more than you can count on one hand.

There are two other PDFs which you can access in addition to the 
Rules Booklet. Please be warned that they are works in progress -- in 
particular, **they contain citations which I have yet to give** and 
content that will undoubtedly change. The first is the 
[Referee Guidebook](TTRPG/GnG_Referee_Guidebook_6_Jan_2024.pdf). This 
contains some explicit explanations behind my design ethos, along with 
some best practices/tips for running the game. You're invited in 
particular to focus on sections which describe ways in which Gold & 
Gallows differs from other roleplaying games, even those with old 
school sensibilities. If you have experience with other systems, Gold & 
Gallows might seem odd at times, so I try to explain the intention 
behind some of its quirks. Please let me know of any places I fall 
short of this goal.

The final PDF is the 
[Modular Rules](TTRPG/GnG_Modular_Rules_6_Jan_2024.pdf), which contains 
a smörgåsbord of extra rules, systems, and ideas. Their inclusion in 
the Rules Booklet would run antithetical to the minimalism ethos, so 
rather than toss them out entirely, they've been quarantined.

### A note on old school inspired mechanics and communities

As stated, one primary design ethos of Gold & Gallows is its rules-
light nature. A lot of old school systems are rules-light as well, 
perhaps mainly by virtue of the fact that they didn't have 50+ years of 
additional ideas on top of them. In addition to being less complex, I 
also generally just like the old school sensibilities: games should be 
driven by players' choices, encounters should require players to plan 
and strategize (not rely on their characters' skills), and the world 
need not be balanced or centered around the players. This ethos is 
sometimes packaged under the OSR (for Old School Renaissance) 
philosophy, but I personally will not identify under that banner. 
Unfortunately there exist a number of people in the OSR with alt-right 
views and several that have acted on such views, and the OSR on the 
whole seems to do little to moderate their presence. Out of solidarity 
with my friends, family, and community, many of whom are affected by 
the beliefs and actions of reactionary right-wing extremism, I do not 
want to prop up or participate in the OSR.
